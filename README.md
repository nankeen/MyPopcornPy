#MyPopcornPy
A script to extract good movies from [GSC](http://gsc.com.my)'s Now Showing list. Made as a project to use Python to automate the boring stuff. This is written for Python 3.5
##Usage

1. Clone this repo
2. Install the dependencies in requirements.txt
3. In the root folder run `python ./MyPopcornPy`

##Features and future developments
* Shows movie information from the omdb API, title, ratings, plot
* Scrapes movie titles from [GSC](http://gsc.com.my/html/movieNowShowing.aspx)
* Finds movies with imdb rating of 8 or higher

I would love to hear suggestions on features to be implemented

###Planned features
* Multithreading to improve speed
* Scraper support for [TGV](http://tgv.com.my)
